## Projects on [Github](https://github.com/sampsale)
<ul>
  <li><b>Guess the Year:</b> JQuery, Bootstrap. An application that displays a series of images and asks the user to guess the year they were taken. The project started as a "hobby project," but the Finnish Broadcasting Company (Yleisradio) became interested in purchasing it. Link to the deployed application <a href='https://yle.fi/aihe/a/20-10004793'>here</a>. The source code is now owned by Yleisradio, but the application is entirely my creation, excluding the non-programming content (images and captions).</li> <img src="images/photoapp.png" width="500" style="margin:100px"/>
  <li><b>Space Launches:</b> Javascript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap:  Upcoming space launches and other information on space exploration; ISS-position on map (GoogleMaps API), people currently in space, search functions for several space related databases. Lots of JSON-data parsng and user interface considerations. Mobile friendly. <b>NB:</b> API-keys not on GitHub.

Linux-servers, with meticulous documentation on setting up a server and purchasing a domain. PersonalTrainer app, built with React using MUI. VisitedCountries, built with Java with SpringBoot and Thymeleaft.</li>
  <li><b>Studied independently: </b><a href="https://github.com/sampsale/PythonCrashCourse">Python Crash Course</a>, <a href="https://fullstackopen.com/">FullStackOpen</a>(work in progress) and several random projects (web scraping, D3, etc). Most of my repos are hidden due to incompleteness or little to no documentation.
